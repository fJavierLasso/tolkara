# Automatic touch controller

Implemented on `feature/touch-controller` from `feature/wow-home` (`2b87fd8`),
2026-10-06. This replaces the earlier feasibility-only proposal. The native mouse
experiment remains separate, and the inherited keyboard correction is retained.
`feature/wolkara` continues from `b55084a` with the settings/editor below.

## Layout and behavior

When the guest window is active and no physical gamepad is connected, a translucent
controller appears automatically. Connecting a physical gamepad removes it;
disconnecting the physical pad restores it. The toolbar's gamepad icon toggles
Automatic / Off and saves that preference. The toolbar moves to the top center
while the touch controller is visible or being configured, leaving the game controls free.

- LT then LB at the upper left; RB then RT at the upper right (left-to-right).
  Triggers are outermost on both sides.
- Two analog sticks at the bottom, with radial dead zones and clamped output.
- Four independent direction buttons form an annular D-pad around the left stick.
- Y/B/A/X form the matching ring around the right stick. Only the visible sectors
  are touch targets; the gaps and empty center do not trigger another button.
- `+` is centered below, aligned with A and the D-pad's down label.
- `−` is omitted at the user's request: Apple's virtual profile does not expose
  an Options/Select button. No keyboard action is substituted for it.

Buttons and axes follow fingers directly, including simultaneous held modifiers
and D-pad diagonals. There are no timed sequences, turbo, macros, automatic game
commands, input broadcasting or gameplay decisions. Touches outside the controls
continue to the existing trackpad. Opening the keyboard, losing focus, entering
the background, hiding the controls or connecting hardware releases held inputs.
A cancelled asynchronous connection cannot restore an unwanted overlay.

## Customization

The fourth toolbar button (gear) opens a scrollable panel. Its Done and Reset
buttons remain pinned at the bottom. The pointer icon toggles the trackpad.

- **Transparency:** 0–80%, applied to the existing translucent artwork;
  default 20% additional transparency. It also applies immediately to all four
  toolbar buttons (pointer, keyboard, controller and settings), including when
  the touch controller is hidden. The saved value is restored at launch.
- **Shoulder button size:** 80–150%, default 100%.
- **Sticks and face button size:** 65–140%, default 100%, subject to available
  safe-area space. Each stick and its annular buttons scale together.
- **Haptic feedback:** on by default, saved on this device. A light tap accompanies
  each new controller-button press (including the D-pad, shoulders, triggers and
  `+`) and each of the four toolbar buttons. Each stick gives a firmer cue when
  it reaches its outer limit. Holding or sliding around the rim stays silent;
  moving inward or lifting the finger rearms the cue. Turning this off silences
  both controller and toolbar feedback without changing game input.
- **Edit layout:** drag either stick/ring group, each rear button, or `+`.
  Done editing exits the editor. Reset to defaults restores all sizes, opacity
  and positions, and enables haptic feedback, without changing whether automatic
  controls are enabled.
  A 24-point grid, symmetric about the safe area's center, appears behind the
  controls while editing. Dashed horizontal/vertical center guides help align
  both sides. These are visual references: dragging stays free, saved positions
  are unchanged and the grid disappears on leaving edit mode.

Settings release held input before opening and suppress game input while open
or editing. Standalone buttons remain touchable in edit mode so their pan
recognizers work; their game values are still blocked. Positions are normalized
to the available safe area, saved locally, and clamped after rotation/resizing.
The toolbar and editor exit remain fixed, so moved controls cannot strand the UI.
Preferences use `WolkaraTouchLayoutV1` and contain no game or account data.
Older saved layouts keep their positions and sizes and default to haptics on.
The pointer symbol has a small optical offset to the right inside its existing
button; the button's size, position and touch target are unchanged.

Haptics use UIKit's public `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator` on the phone. They do not
produce controller rumble, inspect the game or generate additional inputs.
Controller feedback is suspended with input while configuring, hiding controls
or losing focus. Each stick has an independent radial latch (99.5% normalized
output to engage, 85% or less to rearm) so small edge jitter cannot repeat the
pulse. UIKit controls availability on devices without supported haptic hardware;
the keyboard's own system feedback and audio/dictation settings are unchanged.

## Controller API

The adapter uses Apple's public `GCVirtualController` with `hidden = YES` and an
original UIKit layout. The guest receives the system's virtual `GCController`;
physical controllers and their handlers are not modified. The experimental
`translation/GameController` stub is not enabled. No game executable is changed,
no game memory is inspected and no physical-device identity is impersonated.

The configuration retains Apple's legacy layout restrictions even when hidden:
declaring both the D-pad and left stick throws, as do explicit Menu/Options
elements. The connected extended profile nevertheless provides D-pad and Menu.
The public setters for those inputs, alongside both configured sticks and all
face/shoulder/trigger buttons, are verified against the real framework in our
synthetic fixture. Options is absent, so there is deliberately no `−` control.

Apple's standard visible overlay was explored first; its fixed placement was
replaced with the requested custom layout. No copied assets are needed.

## Validation

The fixture contains only original UI and synthetic input, with no game, account
or network connection. It separately exercises delayed/failed connections with
fake transports and real GameController input delivery in the iOS simulator.

```sh
SIMULATOR='<available simulator>' bash tools/test_touch_gamepad_ui.sh --self-test
SIMULATOR='<available simulator>' bash tools/test_touch_gamepad_ui.sh --self-test-input
SIMULATOR='<available simulator>' bash tools/test_touch_controls_ui.sh --self-test --guest-poll-loop
SIMULATOR='<available simulator>' bash tools/test_wow_launcher_ui.sh
SIMULATOR='<available simulator>' bash tools/test_translation_sim.sh
bash tools/test_emulation.sh
```

The input fixture checks all nine buttons, both simultaneous sticks, radial
bounds and malformed coordinates, D-pad diagonals/opposing directions/cancel,
held modifiers, neutral release, annular hit regions, `+` alignment and trackpad
passthrough. The lifecycle fixture checks physical priority, own-controller and
snapshot filtering, keyboard/focus suspension, late replies, error/retry and
teardown. Additional checks cover malformed preferences, clamped sizes,
persistence, resized bounds, all four rear buttons and `+` being hit-testable
and draggable in edit mode, suppressed game input while editing, and reset.
The haptics follow-up checks button press/release deduplication, both stick
edges, edge jitter, inward rearming, cancellation, disabled feedback, preference
persistence and reset, while checking the same real GameController values.
These tests count requested pulses with an original fixture; the simulator
cannot establish the feel or strength of vibration on the physical iPhone.
The launcher fixture checks that status text fits at normal and large
accessibility font sizes.

All six commands above passed with Xcode 27.0 and the iOS 27.0 iPhone 16 Pro Max
simulator. The integration test still asserted the old toolbar's secure-entry
trait; it now checks the separate dictation text view and its disabled spelling
and autocorrection traits. No keyboard implementation change was needed.

The signed device build also passed:

```sh
xcodebuild -project Tolkara.xcodeproj -scheme Tolkara -configuration Debug \
  -sdk iphoneos -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
  -derivedDataPath build/iphone-wolkara-signed ARCHS=arm64 \
  TOLKARA_SYSTEM_ROOTS=YES build
codesign --verify --deep --strict \
  build/iphone-wolkara-signed/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/Tolkara.app
```

Strict signature verification passed with normal access to the macOS keychain.
The only build warnings concerned skipped App Intents metadata extraction.
The embedded AppKit adapter contains the new touch-controller implementation.
This build was not installed on the user's iPhone during this work.

For manual inspection, run the gamepad fixture without a self-test flag. If the
simulator forwards a controller from the Mac, `--ignore-other-controllers` lets
this fixture alone display the touch UI without disconnecting the user's
hardware. Production never uses that override. This option must not be confused
with a successful automatic no-hardware test.

Physical-iPhone usability, Bluetooth handover during gameplay and WoW's response
to this virtual profile still require manual validation. Simulator input success
does not prove game compatibility or Blizzard approval/account safety.
